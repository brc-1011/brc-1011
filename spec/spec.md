## Key Features

### Bitcoin Ordinal Theory and Inscriptions

1. **Fundamental Concept of Ordinal Theory**: Ordinal Theory is a novel approach to distinguish and value individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each satoshi is given a unique identifier (ordinal number), which is determined based on the order of its creation (i.e., when it was mined). This numbering creates a sequence that uniquely identifies every satoshi in existence.

2. **Inscription Process**: Inscriptions in BRC-1011 leverage this unique identification system. They involve embedding data directly onto individual satoshis. This can range from simple text or numbers to more complex data like images or html documents. Inscriptions are immutable once added, inheriting Bitcoin's robust security and immutability.

3. **Uniqueness and Rarity**: The ordinal number of each satoshi can confer a sense of rarity or uniqueness, especially for satoshis mined during significant events or early in Bitcoin's history. This aspect can be particularly appealing in the context of digital collectibles and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

4. **Transparency and Immutability**: Given that these inscriptions are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, they benefit from the inherent transparency and immutability of blockchain technology. Anyone can verify the authenticity and originality of the inscribed data, making it a reliable method of data validation.
